# Python Async Comprehension Project

This project contains tasks related to asynchronous programming in Python. The tasks involve creating asynchronous coroutines and comprehensions to handle various operations. The project is structured to be compatible with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.

## Project Structure

- `0-async_generator.py`: Contains an asynchronous generator coroutine.
- `1-async_comprehension.py`: Contains an asynchronous comprehension coroutine.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Contains a coroutine to measure the runtime of parallel asynchronous comprehensions.
